    "- Optimize Prompt Length - Keep your prompts concise but informative to ensure the model has enough context.Adjust \n",
    "- Temperature and Top_p - Use these parameters to balance between deterministic and creative responses.\n",
    "- Monitor Token Usage - Be mindful of the max_tokens parameter to manage costs and response length.\n",
    "- Use Stopping Sequences - Define stopping sequences to control where the model should stop generating text, ensuring the output is - within the desired context.\n",
    "- Generate Multiple Completions - Use the n parameter to generate multiple completions and select the best one for your needs."
